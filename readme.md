Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Lumen, please send an e-mail to Taylor Otwell at taylor@laravel.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## License

The Lumen framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Integrate with Vehicle Enquiry Click

To integrate with [Vehicle Enquiry Click UI](https://github.com/janjanarnaldo/vehicle-enquiry-click), you will need to create a `.env` file under the root folder and update the following properties accordingly: `APP_URL`, `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` and `TWILIO_SMS_FROM`. Note that the `APP_URL` is your public url that will be used by twilio, and the others as well. APP_URL format: `http://<host>`.

Also, please don't forget to update the `DB_*` environment variables before running your migrations. Refer to Lumen docs if neccessary.
